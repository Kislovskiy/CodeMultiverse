= sbt project compiled with Scala 3

This project is a collection of notes from RockTheJVM https://rockthejvm.com/p/scala[Scala 3 & Functional Programming Essentials] course.

To start the project I did the following steps:

. https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/index.html#install-scala-on-your-computer[installed Scala]
. created `scala-3-beginners` project with `sbt`, by running `sbt new scala/scala3.g8` (https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/index.html#install-scala-on-your-computer[source])

Below is the data autogenerated by `sbt`, will clean it later.

== Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
